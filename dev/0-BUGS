Documentation issues
====================

In the instructions, move section 'Zef Module Manager' to
follow section 'Add rakudo to the PATH'.

Change section named 'Add rakudo to the PATH'.
to 'Add raku to the PATH'.

In section 'Clean up', change the first sentence into two
sentences to read
"First remove the package by running 'apt-get remove rakudo-pkg'.
Then you can safely remove directory '/opt/rakudo-pkg' with any
leftover files."

Change the section named 'Clean up' to 'Removing rakudo-pkg'.

Execution issues
================

When using the rakudo-pkg script to install zef as root, it
installed its version 0.11.7 in '/root/.raku/bin'.
Note the installation used the '--install-to=home' option. 

When I, as root, executed 'zef upgrade zef' I got a message
about unsure how to handle ver 0.18.0 because it's installed.

I tried again, with --force-install and --install-to=home
it upgraded fine.

More testing
============

Redo steps above except: do note use '--install-to' for 
root installation of zef only (except in the existing 
scripts with the rakudo-pkg).

A Makefile for zef upgrade might be useful.

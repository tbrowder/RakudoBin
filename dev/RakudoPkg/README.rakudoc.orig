=head1 NAME

B<RakudoPkg> - Provides tools for easing use of the 'rakudo-pkg' system for Debian and Ubuntu

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use RakudoPkg;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<RakudoPkg> is a Raku module with programs for the root user to bootstrap the 'rakudo-pkg'
installation by use of a system 'rakudo' package installation.
After successful bootstrapping, the system's 'rakudo' package should be deleted
to avoid conflicts.

After the system's 'rakudo' is removed, the 'root' user can manage his or her 'zef' with
the included program 'manage-zef'. A regular user can use it, too.
The program enables the user to install or remove selected Raku module packages.

Note this package is designed for the purpose of standardizing multi-user Linux hosts
for classrooms or computer laboratories.

=head2 Procedures

Normally you will be using this module on a system
which has not had Raku installed other than with its normal
package installation, but it can uninstall
completely any previous such installations.

=head3 Step 1 - Install the Debian or Ubuntu C<rakudo> package

=begin code
$ sudo apt-get install rakudo
=end code

We use the distro's version to 'bootstrap' our desired Rakudo framework.

=head3 Step 2 - Install the C<rakudo-pkg> framework

=begin code
$ sudo rp-root install raku
=end code

The command does the following:

=item deletes any existing /opt/rakudo-pkg directory
=item installs the rakudo-pkg framework
=item installs the new rakudo package

=head3 Step 3 - Remove the system's 'rakudo' package

=begin code
$ sudo apt-get remove rakudo
=end code

=head3 Install the C<zef> module installer

=begin code
$ sudo rp-root install zef
=end code

The command does the following:

=item deletes any existing .raku, .zef, or zef directories for root.
=item installs and updates zef for root

=head3 Install a curated set of modules for public use

A list of modules the author uses is in C<%?RESOURCES>, but another
list may be provided if desired. The input list must be a text file with one
module name per line (along with any adverbs desired).

=head3 Install zef for a user

=begin code
$ rp-user install zef
=end code

The command does the following:

=item deletes any existing .raku, .zef, or zef directories for the user.
=item installs and updates zef for the user.

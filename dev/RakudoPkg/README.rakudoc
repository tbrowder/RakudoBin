=head1 NAME

B<RakudoPkg> - Provides tools for easing installation and use of the C<rakudo-pkg> system for Debian and Ubuntu

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module distribution cannot be installed by C<zef>. Its repository must be downloaded
onto the desired host and then installed by the root user from its top-level directory
in a similar manner to the way C<zef> is installed on a new system.

The package contains programs for the root user to bootstrap the C<rakudo-pkg>
installation by use of a system C<rakudo> package installation.
After successful bootstrapping, the system's C<rakudo> package should be deleted
to avoid conflicts.

Note this package is designed for the purpose of setting up and 
standardizing multi-user Linux hosts
for classrooms or computer laboratories.

=head2 Procedures for installation

Normally you will be using this module on a system
which has not had Raku installed other than with its normal
package installation, but it will uninstall
completely any previous C<rakudo-pkg> installation in an existing
C</opt/rakudo-pkg> directory.

There are three steps to follow.

=head3 Step 1 - Install the Debian or Ubuntu C<rakudo> package and its C<zef>

Since C<zef> depends on C<raku>, all we need to do is install its package (note the package name
is different):

=begin code
$ sudo apt-get install perl6-zef
=end code

We will use the distribution's likely older version to 'bootstrap' our desired Rakudo framework.

=head3 Step 2 - Install the C<rakudo-pkg> framework

=begin code
$ git clone https://github.com/tbrowder/RakudoPkg.git
$ cd RakudoPkg
$ sudo -s
# raku -I ./bin/install-rakudo-pkg
=end code

The command does the following:

=item deletes any existing C</opt/rakudo-pkg> directory
=item installs the C<rakudo-pkg> framework
=item installs the new C<rakudo> package

Prompts are shown at critical points so you can
abort the process if necessary.

=head3 Step 3 - Remove the system's C<rakudo> package

After becoming a normal user again:

=begin code
$ sudo apt-get remove rakudo
=end code

After this step, you may have to logout and login again
to update your path.

Note the Raku package manager C<zef> is not involved at this point. Any previous
installation by any user is not touched. The author is planning a separate
module, tentatively named C<ZefAdmin>, which will help install C<Zef> for
non-conflicting use by both the root user and normal users.

=head2 Procedures for B<complete> removal

Should you ever want to remove the C<rakudo-pkg> installation,
run the following RakudoPkg program as root: C<remove-rakudo-pkg>.

=begin code
$ cd RakudoPkg
$ sudo ./bin/remove-rakudo-pkg
=end code

The pertinent parts of that bash script are shown here:

=begin code
echo "Starting removal of 'rakudo-pkg'..."

apt-get remove rakudo-pkg
rm -rf /opt/rakudo-pkg
rm -rf /etc/profile.d/rakudo-pkg.sh
apt-get update

# clean repository info
rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nxadm-pkgs-rakudo-pkg.list
apt-get clean
rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
apt-get update

echo "Removal of 'rakudo-pkg' is complete."
exit
=end code

Note the removal does not delete anything in any users' home
directory, so there may be C<raku>- or C<zef>-related artifacts remaining
in those places.

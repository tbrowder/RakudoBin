Start with a clean slate:

Step 0 - Clean out root
=======================

+ sudo apt-get remove rakudo-pkg
+ sudo rm -rf /opt/rakudo-pkg
+ sudo rm -rf /root/.raku /root/.zef /root/zef

See script: step-0-clean-root-of-raku-zef.sh

Step 1 - Clean out tbrowde (normal user)
========================================

+ rm -rf ~/.raku ~/.zef ~/zef

See script: step-1-clean-tbrowde-of-raku-zef.sh

Step 2 - Install rakudo-pkg
===========================

+ sudo ./step-2-install-rakudo-pkg.sh

See script: step-2-install-rakudo-pkg.sh

Setting paths
-------------

Rakudo-pkg instructions mention two ways to
set paths to Raku (confusingly, it doesn't
mention why there is the second method):

1. The path is set by an automatically 
intalled '/etc/profile.d/rakudo-pkg.sh'
file which is a symlink to '/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/rakudo-pkg_path.sh'
whose contents sets

  RAKUDO_PATHS=/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin:/opt/rakudo-pkg/share/perl6/bin
  export PATH="$PATH:$RAKUDO-PATHS"

2. There is also a script to set the path manually: 
  '/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/add-rakudo-to-path'. Its contents are a complex
bash script to do accomplish the same as method 1.

After installing raku:
---------------------

Before root runs "raku", he has a path to raku, root 
does NOT have .raku, zef, or .zef directories. 
After root runs "raku" and exits, root DOES
have .raku and .raku/store directories

Before a user runs "raku", he has a path to raku, he
does NOT have .raku, zef, or .zef directories. 
After the user runs "raku" and exits, he DOES
have .raku and .raku/store directories
 
ENSURE THE PREV PARA IS CORRECT!!!

Step 3 - Install zef for root
=============================

Run '/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/install-zef' and zef will
be installed to '~/.raku/bin/zef' and modules to
'~/.raku'.

See script:  


Step 4 - Install zef for a user (tbrowde)
=========================================

Run '/opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/install-zef' and zef will
be installed to '~/.raku/bin/zef' and modules to
'~/.raku'.

See script:  

Alternative for minimalist systems like containers
==================================================

As root run

  /opt/rakudo-pkg/bin/zef-as-root install SuperMAIN

ERROR: That file doesn't seem to exist.


=LATER needs attention after above is satisfactory

For root: 

  # sudo su; cd

Copy the .bashrc from host olg2 whose contents are
in the file 'olg2-root-bashrc.txt' (in this directory).

Add the following env vars for users and root (from gfldex, 2023-08-20):

export RAKUDO_MAX_THREADS=16
export RAKUDO_ERROR_COLOR=yes
export TEST_JOBS=12
export ZEF_TEST_DEGREE=12

Ensure paths to raku and zef are correct and set for myself
and root.
